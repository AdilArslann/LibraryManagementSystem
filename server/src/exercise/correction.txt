Notes:
- Make sure to add .env.example in the client. (COMPLETE)
- Ensure your tests pass on a clean setup and you can measure test coverage. (COMPLETE)
- Prefer timestamps over dates most of the time. (COMPLETE)
- Do not refer to env variables anymore once you have a file responsible for loading and validating them. For example, `server/src/config.ts` now manages configuration, so it should be used instead of `process.env` in `book/create/index.ts`. (COMPLETE)
Bonus:
- For non-exact search for book titles you could look into fuzzy search or semantic search.
- pg_trgm, fuzzystrmatch
- WHERE SIMILARITY(a, 'phrase') > 0.4;
- external services (algolia, elastic search)
